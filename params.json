{"name":"sts","body":"### Welcome to the homepage of sts.\r\n\r\nEver had to painstakingly dig through logs to find the one or two inputs that lead your controller software to break? sts seeks to eliminate this need, freeing you to debug the problematic code itself. \r\n\r\nsts is intended for distributed SDN control software such as [Floodlight](http://floodlight.openflowhub.org/).  sts simulates the devices of your network in a deterministic runtime environment, allowing fine-grained control over the inputs to unmodified* controllers. \r\n \r\n![sts architecture](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~rcs/research/sts_arch.jpg)\r\n\r\nBeyond troubleshooting, sts is also useful as a framework for programmatically generating integration tests.\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nsts depends on [pox](http://www.noxrepo.org/pox/about-pox/). To install sts, you'll just need to pull down a clone of the pox repository:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git clone git://github.com/colin-scott/sts.git\r\n$ cd sts\r\n$ git clone -b debugger git://github.com/noxrepo/pox.git pox/\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Running\r\n\r\nTake sts for a test drive with:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ./simulator.py\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will boot up pox, generate a FatTree network with 16 hosts, and begin feeding in random inputs.\r\n\r\nThe config/ directory contains sample configurations. You can specify your own config file by specifing its module name:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ./simulator.py -c config.my_config\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee [config/README](https://github.com/colin-scott/sts/blob/master/config/README) for more information. \r\n\r\n### Version Notes\r\n\r\nsts requires python 2.7+\r\n\r\nsts will automatically use [pypy](http://pypy.org/) as its interpreter if you place a pypy/ directory at the top-level of the repository.\r\n\r\n### Research\r\n\r\nFor more information about the research behind sts, see our paper [draft](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~rcs/research/hotnets12.pdf). \r\n\r\n*Automatic invariant checking requires an interface to the controllers' view of the network policy.","tagline":"Software-Defined Networking Troubleshooting Simulator","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
