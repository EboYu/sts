 - timed out internal events won't ever overlap: make them red, and skinnier
   than the other events

 - It appears that we don't actually allow new internal messages through! Only
   new internal state transitions

 - Is it always the case that delta debugging will play the MCS at least once
   in an intermediate test?

 - TODO: is the event.time for new ControllerStateChange's correct?

 - TODO: add input_logger= as a part of the config template

 - TODO: we don't actually check that bugs are unambiguous

 - TODO: Log messages that end up sitting in replayer's buffer?
   [new/unexpected evens]. Should timestamp arrival time for all messages.

Questions:
 - Where to mark timed out / new / successful internal events? Replayer, or
   javascript?
     - Do we plan on replaying intermediate replays? -> No, that doesn't
       really make sense [waiting for new internal events?]

 - If we're virtualizing time, does the (javascript) time offset make sense?
