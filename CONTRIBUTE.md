## Adding new features

The best way to add new features is to fork the repository on github and issue a pull
request.

Some tips to getting your pull request accepted:

* Try to adhere to the Google python [style guide](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pyguide.html).
  Note that we use 2 space indentation rather than 4 space indentation.

* Please try to include pydoc strings for your classes and functions.

* If you make a major change to the code, please update our documentation
  [file](https://github.com/ucb-sts/sts/blob/master/DOCUMENTATION.md), which describes
  the overall software architecture of STS.

* Include a unit test in the appropriate tests/ subdirectory. Make sure to run
 `nosetests` and verify that all tests pass before issuing the pull request.

If you there is a feature you would like but you donâ€™t have time to implement
it, issue a feature request [here](http://github.com/ucb-sts/sts/issues).

We also keep a list of features we hope to implement on
[Trello](https://trello.com/board/sts/4f44384523d39fc2042fa672).
