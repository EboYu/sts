Implementation options:
  i.   Add "pass_through + record" mode for BufferedPatchPanel. Drawback: I
       think this may lead to infinite recursion if there are loops installed
       in the network.
  ii.  Use Replayer's DataplaneChecker? Not sure how this will be scheduled
       during peek()'s time.sleep() though.
