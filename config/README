We use python as our DSL for specifying experiment configuration

The module must define the following attribute:
  controllers       => a list of pox.sts.experiment_config_info.ControllerInfo objects

The module can optionally define the following attributes:
  topology_class    => a sts.topology.Topology class (not object!)
                       defining the switches and links
  topology_params   => Comma-delimited list of arguments to pass into the FatTree
                       constructor, specified just as you would type them within
                       the parens.
  patch_panel_class => a sts.topology.PatchPanel class (not object!)
  control_flow      => a sts.control_flow.ControlModule object
  dataplane_trace   => a path to a dataplane trace file
                       (e.g. dataplane_traces/ping_pong_same_subnet.trace)
